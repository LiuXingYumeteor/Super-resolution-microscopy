 Abstract: 
 In this study, we introduce an advanced super-resolution microscopy method. First, a quasi-periodic metallic patch array a quasi-periodic grating capable of converting evanescent waves into propagating waves is designed. The grating is positioned between the object under investigation and the objective lens, the high-frequency information carried by the evanescent waves in the near-field region of the object is transmitted to the far-field for imaging. Subsequently, we provide two deep learning models for image and video reconstructions, respectively, to achieve the reconstruction of far-field imaging for static and dynamic samples. Simulation results demonstrate the high feasibility of the proposed method, enabling rapid localization of sub-wavelength objects with structural features as small as Î»/5. This technology can be directly applied to assist traditional bright-field microscopy without the need for extensive optical system design, and dynamic super-resolution imaging can also be achieved.
